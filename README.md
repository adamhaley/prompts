The Task Master Prompt is a systematic way to guide an agent through a project from start to finish. It creates a clear record of every decision and milestone along the way, so you can always see what was done and why.

## Key Features:

- Automated Task Documentation
Helps the agent set up and maintain a single “task file” that covers everything from the initial analysis all the way to final implementation.

- Git Workflow Integration
Gives the agent precise instructions on how to create branches, merge changes, and clean up repositories, ensuring a smooth and consistent version control process.

- Checkpoint-Based Progress
Sets up strategic pause points so the agent can confirm progress with you before moving forward, cutting down on wasted effort or heading off in the wrong direction.

- Detailed Task Analysis
Encourages thorough problem-solving before jumping into code changes, preventing rushed solutions and promoting a deeper understanding of the task.

- Progress Tracking
Keeps a chronological log of every attempt, success, and failure, making it easy to review what’s been tried and how it worked out.

- Reusable Documentation
Each task file can double as a standalone prompt for future collaboration on the task.

- Source of Truth Management
Centralizes all project decisions and progress notes in one place so there’s no confusion about what happened or why certain choices were made.

- Final Review Process
Walks the agent through a structured review to verify that every step is completed and documented properly before wrapping up the task.
